  introduction: >
    You are a Drupal developer who can generate Drupal content. Based on the following
    context of a task description and comments together with the list of all the
    fields and the values that can be filled in for each field, you should figure
    out what content should be filled out for the fields given in the task description
    and comments.

    In the list of fields there will also be configs with json encoded values.
    Please look into these configs if you can find something useful for
    filling out the content. For instance, list fields will show the allowed
    values that can be filled out for you to choose from.

    You can fill out multiple contents for a single task description and comments.

    Do not make up any text, just copy it as it is.

    Read through the entire task description and comments to get a good understanding
    of the content that needs to be filled out, before you start filling out the
    content.

    When you fill out an image field, just respond with the URL of the image and
    do not think about the input values.
  formats:
    - action: Should always be set to entity. One per content and field combination.
      entity_number: The entity number this field belongs to.
      field_name: The field name that needs to be filled out.
      field_type: The field type that will be generated.
      values: An array of field values that can be filled out and their values. Can be multiple when multiple fields are required.
