# Extra Styleguide Recipe

## Overview

The **Extra Styleguide** recipe (`morethanthemes/extra_styleguide`) configures the **Simple Styleguide** module to provide a visual reference for UI components and theme elements in a Drupal site. It also enables anonymous users to access the style guide by default.
